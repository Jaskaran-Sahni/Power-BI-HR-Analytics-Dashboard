# Power-BI-HR-Analytics-Dashboard 
Procedure Followed:
.Extract data: The data was received from the client in Excel format.

.Transform data: Load the data in Power Bi and further, the data was cleaned by Removing null and duplicate values, rectifying spelling errors and data types in Power Query.

. Load data: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
. Data Modelling: The data modelling process was undertaken to create a logical structure for the data, enabling it to be analyzed and visualized effectively
. Writing DAX: The data was further refined using the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language to create calculated measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis
. Report Building: Once the data was prepared, the dashboard was built with a focus on creating intuitive, user-friendly reports and visualizations
. Publish Report: Finally, the dashboard was published on Power BI Service, allowing the client to easily access the data and insights. A comprehensive report of insights and recommendations was submitted.

Insights Drawn:
1. Maximum attrition happening in the age group of 26 to 35.
2. Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education i.e. 38% and Laboratory Technician as job role.
3. Attrition directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, more chance of attrition.
4. Maximum attrition observed in employees having 1 to 2 years in company.
5. Also average salary is 6.5k, yet employees earning below that slab having higher chances of attrition.


Overall, the guided project was a great learning experience and learned the potential of Power BI as a powerful tool for creating effective dashboards.
